I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Agri Econ at the University of Jon. As an applied microeconomics researcher, my research focuses on international trade, with a particular emphasis on examining the impact of trade remedy and sunset review policies on U.S. trade. I work as a research assistant in Dr. Albert's research group and have presented papers at [AAEA](https://www.aaea.org/UserFiles/file/am23-pro-v3-FINAL.pdf), [CEA](https://www.economics.ca/cpages/who-we-are), [ASHEcon](https://ashecon.confex.com/ashecon/2023/meetingapp.cgi/Session/4772), and [NEARA](https://web.cvent.com/event/7b55727c-b6dd-40cd-8844-95df17a095d6/summary). I am also an [instructor of record](https://catalog.uconn.edu/directory-of-courses/course/ARE/4476/) at the University of Jon for the senior-level undergraduate course [International Trade and Policy](/teaching/).

I'm in the 2023-24 job market, and I'll be presenting my work at the [2023 INCS](https://iatrc.umn.edu/2023-iatrc-annual-meeting/). My job market paper examines the effects of the implementation of anti-dumping and countervailing duties on US agricultural imports.
